Checklist for Tagging a New Release
--------------------------------------
- Update the version = "x.y.z" line near the top of Project.toml
  to be the new version number and commit this change
- On the Github website for ITensors.jl, click on Code tab, 
  then the link to the individual commits (showing total 
  number of commits) then click on a commit occurring on
  or after the change to Project.toml
- In the comments under this commit, add the comment:
  @JuliaRegistrator register
- Wait an hour or so for the JuliaRegistrator bot to
  update the official Julia registry 
- The TagBot bot should also create a new tag and version on Github
  automatically (if you see a notice about "Trigger TagBot Issue"
  it does not mean that TagBot isn't working or has an issue, it 
  is just literally a Github issue used to trigger TagBot to run)
- TagBot helpfully explains the differences from the previous 
  versions in the Github version entry. This can be useful for
  updating the NEWS.md file.
